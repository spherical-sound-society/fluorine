Fluorine is an handheld synthesizer designed for creating futuristic rhythms and textures, akin to sculpting sonic landscapes.

It employs a novel synthesis technique known as Recursive Bytebeats. To use it, you simply explore its capabilities by adjusting the knobs, similar to tuning an alien radio station.
